# Functional Flow Block Diagrams

This folder contains stencils to make [Functional Flow Block Diagrams (FFBD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_flow_block_diagram). Although FFBDs are relatively common, there are no authoritative standards defining FFBD structure. This library provides two FFBD stencils for use with draw.io:

1. FFBD Without Item Flow
2. FFBD With Item Flow

### FFBD Without Item Flow
This stencil implements FFBD as defined in Supplement 5-A (p49-50) of the January 2001 version of Systems Engineering Fundamentals from the Defense Acquisition University Press. A scanned copy of the publication is available on the [Defence Technical Information Centre website](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA387507.pdf). A non-scanned version of the same document is available on [NASA's Space Systems Engineering website](https://spacese.spacegrant.org/SEModules/Reference%20Docs/DAU_SE_Fundamentals.pdf) although some of the front matter is missing. The publication is freely available and there are lots of other places it can be found.
